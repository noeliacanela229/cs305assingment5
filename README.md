## A repository for use throughout assignment 5 in CS305. 

### My Project:

I would like to work on a project that can help people decide what they are going to wear. 

There are many reasons I want to make a project like this:
>
One being that I never know what to wear, so this would help people like me make a machine do it for them.
>
Now I want to finish this code because I want to have a project to put in my resume when I create my job portfolio.

#### Things that I may need to do in order to finish this project:

1. Learn how to search the web using the user's common interests.
   - This includes 
   - Selecting users clothing preferences prior
   - Knowing the things that they would not like
2. Modify areas of code that may not be functional
3. These are things that I would like to do.

### Potential New Module: 
> I think it would be cool if we could have the user input their favorite color then suggest outfits that match that!
